# Keras Segmentation Models

A set of models which allow easy creation of Keras models to be used for segmentation tasks.

# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/Fully-Connected-DenseNets-Semantic-Segmentation">Fully Connected DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation</a>

# Keras Recurrent Neural Networks

A set of scripts which can be used to add custom Recurrent Neural Networks to Keras.

-----

# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/Keras-just-another-network-JANET">Chrono Initializer, Chrono LSTM and JANET</a>
Keras implementation of the paper [The unreasonable effectiveness of the forget gate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04849) and the Chrono initializer and Chrono LSTM from the paper [Can Recurrent Neural Networks Warp Time?](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJcKhk-Ab). 

This model utilizes just 2 gates - forget (f) and context (c) gates out of the 4 gates in a regular LSTM RNN, and uses `Chrono Initialization` to acheive better performance than regular LSTMs while using fewer parameters and less complicated gating structure.

## Usage
Simply import the `janet.py` file into your repo and use the `JANET` layer. 

It is **not** adviseable to use the `JANETCell` directly wrapped around a `RNN` layer, as this will not allow the `max timesteps` calculation that is needed for proper training using the `Chrono Initializer` for the forget gate.

The `chrono_lstm.py` script contains the `ChronoLSTM` model, as it requires minimal modifications to the original `LSTM` layer to use the `ChronoInitializer` for the forget and input gates.

Same restrictions to usage as the `JANET` layer, use the `ChronoLSTM` layer directly instead of the `ChronoLSTMCell` wrapped around a `RNN` layer.

```python
from janet import JANET
from chrono_lstm import ChronoLSTM

...
```

To use just the `ChronoInitializer`, import the `chrono_initializer.py` script.

-----

# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/Keras-IndRNN">Independently Recurrent Neural Networks (SRU)</a>
Implementation of the paper [Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN): Building A Longer and Deeper RNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04831) for Keras 2.0+. IndRNN is a recurrent unit that can run over extremely long time sequences, able to learn the additional problem over 5000 timesteps where most other models fail..

## Usage
Usage of IndRNNCells
```python
from ind_rnn import IndRNNCell, RNN

cells = [IndRNNCell(128), IndRNNCell(128)]
ip = Input(...)
x = RNN(cells)(ip)
...
```
Usage of IndRNN layer
```python
from ind_rnn import IndRNN

ip = Input(...)
x = IndRNN(128)(x)
...
```
-----

# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/keras-SRU">Simple Recurrent Unit (SRU)</a>
Implementation of the paper [Training RNNs as Fast as CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755) for Keras 2.0+. SRU is a recurrent unit that can run over 10 times faster than cuDNN LSTM, without loss of accuracy tested on many tasks, when implemented with a custom CUDA kernel.

This is a naive implementation with some speed gains over the generic LSTM cells, however its speed is not yet 10x that of cuDNN LSTMs.

-----


# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/Keras-Multiplicative-LSTM">Multiplicative LSTM</a>
Implementation of the paper [Multiplicative LSTM for sequence modelling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07959.pdf) for Keras 2.0+. Multiplicative LSTMs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art or close to SotA results for sequence modelling datasets. They also perform better than stacked LSTM models for the Hutter-prize dataset and the raw wikipedia dataset.


## Usage

Add the `multiplicative_lstm.py` script into your repository, and import the MultiplicativeLSTM layer.

Eg. You can replace Keras LSTM layers with MultiplicativeLSTM layers.
```
from multiplicative_lstm import MultiplicativeLSTM
```
-----

# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/keras-minimal-rnn">Minimal RNN</a>
Implementation of the paper [MinimalRNN: Toward More Interpretable and Trainable Recurrent Neural Networks
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06788) for Keras 2.0+. Minimal RNNs are a new recurrent neural network architecture that achieves comparable performance as the popular gated RNNs with a simplified structure. It employs minimal updates within RNN, which not only leads to efficient learning and testing but more importantly better interpretability and trainability

## Usage

Import minimal_rnn.py and use either the MinimalRNNCell or MinimalRNN layer

```python
from minimal_rnn import MinimalRNN 

# this imports the layer rather than the cell
ip = Input(...)  # Rank 3 input shape
x = MinimalRNN(units=128)(ip)
...
```
-----

# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/Nested-LSTM">Nested LSTM</a>
Implementation of the paper [Nested LSTMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10308) for Keras 2.0+. Nested LSTMs add depth to LSTMs via nesting as opposed to stacking. The value of a memory cell in an NLSTM is computed by an LSTM cell, which has its own inner memory cell. Nested LSTMs outperform both stacked and single-layer LSTMs with similar numbers of parameters in our experiments on various character-level language modeling tasks, and the inner memories of an LSTM learn longer term dependencies compared with the higher-level units of a stacked LSTM

## Usage
```python
from nested_lstm import NestedLSTM

ip = Input(shape=(nb_timesteps, input_dim))
x = NestedLSTM(units=64, depth=2)(ip)
...
```

# Keras Modules

A set of scripts which can be used to add advanced functionality to Keras.

# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/keras-switchnorm">Switchable Normalization for Keras</a>
Switchable Normalization is a normalization technique that is able to learn different normalization operations for different normalization layers in a deep neural network in an end-to-end manner.

Keras port of the implementation of the paper Differentiable Learning-to-Normalize via Switchable Normalization.

Code ported from the switchnorm official repository.

# **Note**

This only implements the moving average version of batch normalization component from the paper. The batch average technique cannot be easily implemented in Keras as a layer, and therefore it is not supported.

## Usage
Simply import switchnorm.py and replace BatchNormalization layer with this layer.

```python
from switchnorm import SwitchNormalization

ip = Input(...)
...
x = SwitchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
...
```

-----

# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/Keras-Group-Normalization">Group Normalization for Keras</a>
A Keras implementation of [Group Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494) by Yuxin Wu and Kaiming He.

Useful for fine-tuning of large models on smaller batch sizes than in research setting (where batch size is very large due to multiple GPUs). Similar to Batch Renormalization, but performs significantly better on ImageNet.

As can be seen, GN is independent of batchsize, which is crucial for fine-tuning large models which cannot be retrained with small batch sizes due to Batch Normalization's dependence on large batchsizes to compute the statistics of each batch and update its moving average perameters properly.

## Usage

Dropin replacement for BatchNormalization layers from Keras. The important parameter that is different from `BatchNormalization` is called `groups`. This must be appropriately set, and requires certain constraints such as :

1)  Needs to an integer by which the number of channels is divisible.
2)  `1 <= G <= #channels`, where #channels is the number of channels in the incomming layer.

```python
from group_norm import GroupNormalization

ip = Input(shape=(...))
x = GroupNormalization(groups=32, axis=-1)
...
```

-----

# <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/keras-normalized-optimizers">Normalized Optimizers for Keras</a>
Keras wrapper class for Normalized Gradient Descent from [kmkolasinski/max-normed-optimizer](https://github.com/kmkolasinski/deep-learning-notes/tree/master/max-normed-optimizer), which can be applied to almost all Keras optimizers.

Partially implements [Block-Normalized Gradient Method: An Empirical Study for Training Deep Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04822) for all base Keras optimizers, and allows flexibility to choose any normalizing function. It does not implement adaptive learning rates however.

## Usage

```python
from keras.optimizers import Adam, SGD
from optimizer import NormalizedOptimizer

sgd = SGD(0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
sgd = NormalizedOptimizer(sgd, normalization='l2')

adam = Adam(0.001)
adam = NormalizedOptimizer(adam, normalization='l2')
```
